feature of java
1. Simple
Easy to learn and use. Java removes complex features like pointers and operator overloading.
2.Object Oriented
Everything in Java is treated as an object, which makes the code modular, flexible, and reusable.
3.Platform-Independent
Java code is compiled into bytecode which can run on any system using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
4. Secure
Java has built-in security features like bytecode verification, security update and exception handling to protect against viruses and unauthorized access.
5. Robust
Strong memory management, automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and type checking make Java reliable.
6.Multithreaded
Java supports multithreading — the ability to run multiple threads (small programs) at the same time, improving performance.

annomous inner class ,object

Q. What is lambda expression and what is the benefit of lambda expression?
______________________________________________________
Lambda expression is shortcut of anonymous inner class so the benefit of lambda expression is reduce the boiler plate code which is generated by anonymous inner class 
class name ref=()=>{
//override method
};
ref.method;

@FunctionalInterface
interface A{
  void display();
}
public class Jdk
{
public static void main(String x[])
{

  A a=()->{  System.out.println("Om sai Ram");  };
 a.display();  //call override method
}
}


Q. What is an anonymous inner class?
________________________________________________________
Anonymous inner class is basically a local inner class where we create an object of class as well as define its body and override its method called anonymous inner class.
ex->
class name ref=new class name()
{
  override method
};
 class name.methodName();

ex->class A {
    void test() {
        System.out.println("hello");
    }
}
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal obj = new Animal() {   // anonymous inner class
            void test() {
                System.out.println("world");
            }
        };
        obj.test();  // Output: world ->overide kelya mul hello print nahi zala
    }
}

Q-what is anonymous  inner object
An anonymous object in Java is an object that is created without a reference variable and is used only once,
ex->new test();
can we covert all class as  annomous class
lambda expression -> write and annomous inner class
method hiding 

Anonomus array->
array without name ;
 Synaxt->array->new int[]{};
how symanic  tag effect on in our html  -> syamic tag ni html page vr ky farak padto
1->make page seo friendly

    -It is a style sheet language
    -Defines style of a webpage
